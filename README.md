# Augmented Reality Telepresence for *Double 3*
## Overview
The [*Double 3*]() is the latest telepresence system released by [*Double Robotics*](). It allows users to remotely move around an environment whilst conducting a video call, giving them a physical presence in the space and greater control than traditional video conferencing.

This project explores the viability and value of broadening the telepresence offering on the platform, such as empowering users with teleoperation, and embedding virtual information into the environment. Interaction with the additional features is unified into an expanded augmented reality experience. A full explanation of the additional features can be found on the [system configuration]() page.

In addition to the software itself, this documentation critically analyses the process of developing additional functionality for the *Double 3*, which is a platform with seemingly zero third-party, open-source developer precedent beyond the tools and support offered by *Double Robotics*.
